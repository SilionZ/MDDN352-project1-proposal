							<h3>Meaning of the LOGO</h3>
							<p>The F in this Logo means Feminism and the pentagon refer to AR technology. It is clear in this proposal, I will use AR technology to create an App to help people learning the history of New Zealand's feminism while they walk around some main street in Wellington city.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Inspiration</h3>
							<p>My idea of this project was inspired by A petition: Womenâ€™s Suffrage Petition in National Library in Wellington. New Zealand is the first country could let all women have their right to vote in general elections. We should remember this history and show the younger how they fright for their right and make it easy to understand and be remarkable.</p>

							<h3>How it connect with Wellington</h3>
							<p>In New Zealand history website, it has the name list of the women suffrage petition. Because the parliament house is in Wellington that the project main focusing will be in Wellington.</p>

							<h3>How this app work</h3>
							<p>In this app, it will have GPS to track your location. When you arrived at particular place, the app will notice you and you can open the app use the AR technology to see why it had connection with the Feminism.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>How the AR technology work</h3>
							<p>When you arrived at a particular place, you can open App's AR technology to scan the doorplate and it will come out the paper that her signed and maybe a photo of her. For example, E A. Marchant, She lived in 50 The Terrace and when you scan the 50 The Terrace doorplate it will come out her image and the sheet which her signed. It also will be background audio talking about her life.</p>

	<h2>My idea also inspired by Soundsky. <br>Soundsky is an app about telling an invisible memories, stories, secrets in Chirstchurch.<br> That's how I come out the idea of play audio during the AR technology.</h2>
	<h5>In my app, the story and history will be more reality than the SoundSky. Also it will easy to help people to remember this history.</h5>
